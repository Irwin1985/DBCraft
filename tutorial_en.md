# **Guide to Defining Tables with DBCraft**

**Â¡Welcome to the guide for defining tables with DBCraft!** 

In this documentation, we will show you how to use **DBCraft** attributes to create tables in standardized databases easily and effectively. This guide is designed to be understandable by anyone, whether they are programmers or database analysts.

## **Introduction to DBCraftt**

DBCraft is a tool that simplifies the creation of tables in databases, regardless of the programming language you are using. It uses a simple syntax inspired by YAML to describe tables and their fields, making the definition process much more comprehensible and organized.

## **General Table Attributes**

### **`name`**

This attribute defines the name of the table you want to create. Make sure the name is unique within your database.

Example:

```yaml
- table:
  name: customers
```

### **`description`**

Here you can provide an optional description for the table you are defining. This can help other developers understand the purpose of the table.

Example:

```yaml
- table:
  name: customers
  description: "Table that stores customer information."
```

> ***NOTE:** Names with spaces should be enclosed in double or single quotes.*

## **Field Definitions**

### **`fields`**

The **`fields`** attribute is used to define the list of fields or columns that the table will have. Each field has its own attributes that detail its properties.

### Field Attributes

- **`name`**: The name of the field you are defining.
- **`type`**: [The data type](data_types.md) of the field, such as **`int`**, **`varchar`**, **`date`**, etc.
- **`size`**: The length of the data type (mandatory for **`char`**).
- **`decimal`**: The number of decimals for numeric fields.
- **`allowNull`**: Indicates whether the field allows null values (**`true`** o **`false`**).
- **`default`**: Default value for the field.
- **`description`**: A comment for the field.
- **`autoIncrement`**: Indicates whether the field is auto-incrementable (**`true`** o **`false`**).
- **`primaryKey`**: Indicates whether the field is a primary key (**`true`** o **`false`**).
- **`index`**: Defines an index for the field.

### Field Definition Example

```yaml
- table:
  name: customers
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: int
      size: 11
      primaryKey: true
    - name: customer_name
      type: varchar
      size: 100
```

> ***NOTE:** Have you noticed that all attributes are aligned with each other? That's because whitespace counts, so make sure to align your attributes properly.*

## **Composite Indexes**

### **`composed`**

This attribute allows you to define composite indexes, which are indexes that involve multiple columns.

### Composite Index Attributes

- **`columns`**: An array with the names of the columns that will form the index.
- **`name`**: The name of the composite index.
- **`sort`**: The order of the index (**`asc`** o **`desc`**).
- **`unique`**: Indicates whether the index is unique or not (**`true`** o **`false`**).

### Composite Index Example

```yaml
- table:
  name: invoices
  composed:
    -columns: [customer_id, date]
    name: idx_invoices_customers_date
    sort: asc
    unique: false
```
